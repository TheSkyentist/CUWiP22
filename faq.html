										<h1>Q: What is CUWiP?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>The APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) are three-day regional conferences for undergraduate physics majors. The 2022 conferences will be held January 21-23, 2022.</p>
										<p>The goal of APS CUWiP is to help undergraduate women continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference, information about graduate school and professions in physics, and access to other women in physics of all ages with whom they can share experiences, advice, and ideas. The national and local organizing committees of APS CUWiP strive to create a welcoming environment for all, including undergraduate women and gender minorities.</p>
										<p>The 2022 program at University of Arizona will include research talks, panel discussions about graduate school and careers in physics, workshops and discussions about women in physics, student research talks and poster sessions, and laboratory tours.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: How do you pronounce CUWiP?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
											<p>Most people say "Cue-Wip".</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: Who is invited to attend CUWiP?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>Any undergraduate student with an interest in physics may apply to attend a CUWiP. Undergraduate students are eligible to apply and register for the conference, and we encourage non-undergraduate students or interested faculty/mentors to email <site email> for details about attendance and participation. [you could also just link your non-student participants registration form]</p>
										</details>	


									</div>

									<div id="eligibility">
										
										<header class="style1"><h2>Eligibility</h2></header>

										<h1>Q: Do I need to have research to present in order to attend the conference?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>No. While we encourage you to present a talk or a poster if you have been involved in research, you are welcome to attend the conference and participate in the activities.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: I attended last year; can I come to this year’s conference, too?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>The content of this year’s conference will not be exactly the same as last year’s, and you are welcome to apply to attend again. However, if more students apply than we can accommodate, preference will be given to students who have never attended a CUWiP.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: I am a local student. Do I need to register?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>Yes, all attendees must register by the deadline, <b>Monday, October 4th, 2021 at 5pm ET.</b></p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: I'm a student from Canada. Can I apply to a U.S. CUWiP?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>Students from Canada are encouraged to apply to the Canadian site at the University of Toronto. Students from Canada may apply to U.S. CUWiP if desired. However, Canadian students accepted to U.S. sites are not eligible for reimbursement of travel expenses from the conference or for waiver of the registration fee.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: I'm a student in a country other than the United States or Canada. Can I apply for CUWiP?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>TBD</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: I'm a community college student. Am I eligible to apply to CUWiP?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>Yes, undergraduate students at any U.S. college or university may apply.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: I'm a high school student/grad student/postdoc/faculty member. Am I eligible to apply to CUWiP?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>Only undergraduate students who will be over 18 at the time of the conference may apply to CUWiP. <Site should insert what other interested attendees should do, since it's up to sites to decide how to handle non-undergrads. Usually it's best to accommodate mentors who are traveling with students, but there is no obligation to accommodate others.></p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: I am transgender/gender-fluid/genderqueer/non-binary etc, can I attend this conference?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>Yes, students of all genders are welcome to attend this conference. If you have questions, or concerns about the housing for this conference, please contact us at <site email>.</p>
										</details>	

									</div>

									<div id="application">
										
										<header class="style1"><h2>Application & Registration</h2></header>

										<h1>Q: Who can attend? Do I need to be a physics major to apply?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>It is very important to complete all parts of the application and to write a thoughtful Applicant Statement. If conferences are oversubscribed, priority will be given to applicants who:
										<ol>
											<li>Are undergraduate physics or engineering physics majors.</li>
											<li>Have never attended an APS CUWiP.</li>
										</ol>
										</p>
										<p>There is no formal application or registration process for non-undergraduate students and interested faculty/mentors. We encourage you to email <site email> for details about attendance and participation.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: What’s the difference between "application" and "registration"?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>You <b>apply</b> to attend CUWiP, the CUWiP leadership directs you to a site, the site reviews your application and you are accepted, wait-listed or declined according to the priorities listed above. Application is free, and the deadline is <b>Monday, October 4th, 2021 at 5pm ET.</b></p>
										<p>After you have been accepted, you will <b>register</b> for your accepted site to confirm that you will actually be attending, and provide specifics, such as special accomodations and dietary restrictions. There is a one-time registration fee of $45, which helps offset some of the cost of the conference. The conference provides all lodging and meals. If necessary, the registration fee can be waived. To request a fee waiver, please contact women@aps.org.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: Why can I not apply to a specific site?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>As CUWiP is so popular, we need to carefully balance the loads across the sites to minimize travel costs and maximize the number of students who can attend CUWiP. Please do not book travel until you receive an acceptance email from, and complete registration for, a specific site.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: Do I need to book my travel before registering?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>No, but you should have an estimate of the cost. If you are traveling by air, or long distance train or bus, and your travel cost is not covered by your department, your travel agenda and cost <b>must be approved by the conference site organizers before you book your travel</b>. Email us at <site email> for approval. Due to the limited nature of our travel funds, we ask that you find the most economical means of transportation to and from the conference. For example, reach out to others in your department and see if carpooling is an option.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: What will increase my chances of being accepted to the conference?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>First, make sure you submit your application by the deadline, Monday, October 4th, 2021 at 5pm ET.<p>
										<p>Second, make sure you put some thought into why you want to attend and what you want to get out of the conference. Please answer all questions on the application fully and honestly. Offering to present a talk or a poster, or indicating interest in travel support, will not affect your chances of being selected to attend.</p>
										</details>	

									</div>

									<div id="cost">
										
										<header class="style1"><h2>Cost & Funding</h2></header>

										<h1>Q: How much does the conference cost?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>Students who are accepted to attend the conference must pay a one-time registration fee of $45, which helps offset some of the cost of the conference, including all lodging and meals. Lodging (for non-local students) and food will be covered by the conference; you do not need to pay for your hotel room or food at the conference. We expect that your travel expenses will be covered by your home department or college. However, if they are not able to cover these expenses, travel funding is available <sites should specify where to find details about travel funding>.</p>
										<p>If you cannot afford the registration fee and your department/college is unable to help, you may request a fee waiver by emailing women@aps.org for the appropriate form. The request takes approximately 48 hours to review. You must request a fee waiver before registering. <b>The deadline to request a fee waiver is on Wednesday, November 10, 2021 at 5:00 PM ET for initially accepted students and Wednesday, December 1, 2021 at 5:00pm ET for formally wait-listed, second round accepted students.</b> Please do not wait until the last minute to request the waiver and/or to register. For more information on fee waivers, contact women@aps.org.</p>
										<p><b>Please note that the deadline for students to cancel registration and receive a refund is on Friday, December 17, 2021 at 5:00 p.m. ET. Any cancellations beyond that date are non-refundable.</b></p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: How do I know the amount my department will contribute to my travel funding?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>Please talk to your department chair, manager, or director of undergraduate studies before registering for CUWiP. You might ask an academic advisor, faculty member you know, or other mentor for guidance about who to ask if you are unsure. You can also contact us if you would like guidance in asking your department for travel funds.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: My institution would like to cover the registration fee for me and other students in my department. Is there an option to do this?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>We now offer a payment option for departments who would like a secure way to pay for their students. Please have your institution complete the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2A3fZnZCByFat4yC0S1XRoVMw2h7gkarU7_YbxB2ADIc2bg/viewform?usp=sf_link">CUWiP 2022 Registration Payment Request Form</a>. After the request is reviewed, your institution will receive a link to submit the payment. Once the payment is complete, we will provide the student(s) with a coupon code to enter at checkout. Upon checking out, the student will see a $0 fee.

										<header class="style1"><h2>Travel & Accomodations</h2></header>

										<h1>Q: How do I arrange travel?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>

										<h1>Q: What if I need child care??</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>	
										<p>Please contact us to discuss your needs at <site email>.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: What are pronouns?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>The pronoun that a person chooses to use for themselves. For example: If Xena's preferred pronouns are she, her, and hers, you could say "Xena ate her food because she was hungry." She, her, hers and he, him, his are common examples of pronouns. Some people call these "female/feminine" and "male/masculine" pronouns, but many avoid these labels because, for example, not everyone who uses he feels like a "male" or "masculine."</p>

										<p>There are also lots of gender-neutral pronouns in use. Here are a few you might hear:
										<ul>
											<li>They, them, theirs (Xena ate their food because they were hungry.) This is a pretty common gender-neutral pronoun.... And yes, it can in fact be used in the singular.</li>
											<li>Ze, hir (Xena ate hir food because ze was hungry.) Ze is pronounced like "zee" can also be spelled zie or xe, and replaces she/he/they. Hir is pronounced like "here" and replaces her/hers/him/his/they/theirs.</li>
											<li>ust my name please! (Xena ate Xena's food because Xena was hungry) Some people prefer not to use pronouns at all, using their name as a pronoun instead.</li>
										</ul>
										</p>

										<p>Never, ever refer to a person as “it” or “he-she” (unless they specifically ask you to.) These are often used as offensive slurs. Based on the information <a target="_blank" href="https://www.samuelmerritt.edu/pride/gender#What">here</a> and resources linked therein.</p>
										</details>	


										<h1>Q: Why does CUWiP ask for my preferred pronouns? Why should I consider putting them on my name badge?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>		
										<p>CUWiP seeks to be a safe space for all participants. By asking for preferred pronouns, we are ensuring that we don’t accidentally misgender any of our participants or make harmful assumptions based on appearance. Even if you have never considered this in relation to yourself, by including your preferred pronouns on your name badge you can help to make other CUWiP participants comfortable. We hope you will consider this.</p>
